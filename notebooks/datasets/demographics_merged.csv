5f328592c528f6049d0df10e,Female,21,Secondary School,5,5,2,"I have very mixed feelings on reddit as anews source because it completely depends on what subreddits you decide to follow, and what you engage with at most.

60fd543ed6a1eabab523780b,Female,19,Undergraduate,3,5,4,"I think that Reddit can be a good place to read lots of perspectives on one topic and give yourself a broader range of information. Within one post’s comment section, you’re likely to see varying opinions, which may open up your mind to a perspective you haven’t yet been looking from. The same cannot be said for news channels or specific newspapers/blogs/websites. Many are privately owned, and when one person has control over the content, it’s not unlikely that they’re pushing their own agendas and opinions. Hence, Reddit is a better place to widen your view. However, anybody can post on Reddit. While all of the articles shown in this study provided links, some of the links were biased news sources, which brings us back to square one. Being a social media, people can be very quick to spread misinformation without properly checking what they say. Whether that’s due to malicious intentions or pure ignorance, there is always a risk that what you read on Reddit is simply a trending falsity. ","In terms of initial impression, I look to the layout of the post. If the title is easy to read, unopinionated, and the photo chosen is also clear and coherent, I naturally perceive it as more reliable. However, if the title is too wordy, uses incorrect spellings/grammar, or written in an unprofessional way, then I naturally discredit it. After initial impressions, I mainly look then to the link attached. If I recognise the source to be relatively objective and reliable, then I don’t question it much more. However, links to pop-culture blogs or news immediately makes it seem like an opinion-piece to me, rather than an unbiased article. Additionally, the interactions on the post give me some insight into its credibility. For example, a post with lots of comments, and a high amount of upvotes makes me assume that it’s at least somewhat credible (or at least, not obviously wrong).",White,Poland
