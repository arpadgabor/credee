First - is it interesting and you want to go there, and second - is it real. I think if you are watching specific topics on reddit, it might be good for you. But the risk is that it will surface a topic that is just popular now, and not necessarily relevant. You're also never sure if a user isn't intentionally introducing misinformation. You have to be careful. I prefer local news sites, where publications are handled by journalists and editors are responsible for accuracy. Then there is a better chance that what I read or see will be the truth.","First, I check that the title is understandable to me and sounds plausible. I look immediately at the source - is it a well-known trade magazine, or maybe the website of some TV station? Later, I open the article or video and check the sources it is based on. Does the author of the text refer to reliable publications, or is it based only on rumors? I also check who are the people, guests, scientists the author is referring to.
